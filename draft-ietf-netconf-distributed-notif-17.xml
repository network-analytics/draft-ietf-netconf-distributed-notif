      <t>This document describes extensions to the YANG notifications
      subscription to allow metrics being published directly from
    processors on line cards to target receivers, while subscription
    is still maintained at the route processor in a distributed
    forwarding system of a network node.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The mechanism to support a subscription of a continuous and
      customized stream of updates from a YANG datastore <xref
      target="RFC8342"/> is defined in <xref target="RFC8639"/> and 
      <xref target="RFC8641"/>. Requirements for Subscription to YANG
      Datastores are defined in <xref target="RFC7923"/>.</t>

      <t>By streaming YANG-Push notifications from publishers to
      receivers, much better performance and fine-grained sampling can
      be achieved than with a polling-based mechanism. In a distributed
      forwarding system on a network node, the packet forwarding is
			delegated to multiple processors on line cards. In order not to
			overwhelm the route processor resources, it is not uncommon that
			data records are published directly from processors on line cards
			to target receivers to further increase efficiency on the routing
			system.</t>

      <t>This document complements the general subscription requirements
      defined in <xref section="4.2.1" sectionFormat="of"
			target="RFC7923"/> by the paragraph: A Subscription Service MAY
			support the ability to export from multiple software processes on
			a single routing system and expose the information which software
			process produced which message.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Terminologies">
      <t>The following terms are defined in <xref target="RFC8639"/> and
      are not redefined here:</t>

      <t>Subscriber</t>

      <t>Publisher</t>

      <t>Receiver</t>

      <t>Subscription</t>

      <t>The following terms are defined in <xref target="RFC9196"/> and
      are not redefined here:</t>

      <t>Capability</t>

      <t>In addition, this document defines the below terms. Some 
			of these terms are distinguished between global versus component
			and parent versus agent to distinguish their role within the
			distributed system. Where global and component is used to
			distinguish wherever the system component is reachable outside the distributed system or not. Parent and agent is used to distinguish wherever it manages or is being managed within the distributed
			system.</t>

      <t>Global Subscription: The Subscription requested by the
      Subscriber as described in Sections 2.4 and 2.5 of <xref
			target="RFC8639"/>. It may be decomposed into multiple Component
      Subscriptions.</t>

      <t>Component Subscription: The Subscription that defines a data
      source which is managed and controlled by a single Publisher.</t>

      <t>Global Capability: The overall subscription capability that the
      group of Publishers can expose to the Subscriber as defined in
      <xref target="RFC9196"/> for the distributed system. This includes
      which YANG nodes can be subscribed at which minimum-update-period
      for periodical subscriptions respectively which
      minimum-dampening-period for on-change subscriptions.</t>

      <t>Component Capability: The subscription capability that each
      Publisher exposes to the Publisher Parent. This includes 
      which YANG nodes with which minimum-update-period for periodical
      subscriptions respectively which minimum-dampening-period for
      on-change subscriptions can be subscribed on which Component.</t>

      <t>Publisher Parent: The component of a Publisher that interacts
			with the Subscriber to deal with the Global Subscription. It
			decomposes the Global Subscription to multiple Component
			Subscriptions and interacts with the Publisher Agents.</t>

      <t>Publisher Agent: The component of a Publisher that interacts
			with the Publisher Parent to deal with the Component Subscription
			and pushing the data to the Receiver.</t>

      <t>Network Node: Is the network node of a distributed system which
			contains one or more Publishers that obtains the data from the
			YANG datastore and pushes it to the Receiver.</t>

      <t>Message Publisher: The Publisher that pushes the message to the
      Receiver.</t>

      <t>Message Publisher ID: A 32-bit identifier of the publishing
      process that is locally unique to the Network Node. With this
      identifier the publishing process from where the message was
      published from can be uniquely identified. Receivers SHOULD use
      the transport session and the Publisher ID field to separate
      different publisher streams originating from the same network
      Node.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Motivation and Solution Overview">
      <t>In distributed forwarding systems of Network Nodes much YANG
			data is subscribed to processors on line cards but published from
			the route processor instead. This creates an unnecessary overhead
			at the route processor and a potential bottleneck instead of
			publishing the YANG data from processors on line cards directly.</t>

      <t>This document proposes that subscribed YANG data can be
			published from processors on line cards. The route processor is
			only involved in maintaining and decomposing the Subscription,
			which includes notifying the Receiver which Subscription is being
			published from which line card processor with subscription state
			change notifications.</t>

      <t>To enable Receivers to map notification messages to a
			particular Publisher, the Message Publisher ID in the transport
			message header of the YANG notification message is introduced. In
			case of UDP transport, this is described in <xref
			section="3.2" sectionFormat="of"
			target="I-D.ietf-netconf-udp-notif"/>. With unique
			sequence-numbers per publishing process described in <xref
			section="3.4.1" sectionFormat="of"
			target="I-D.ietf-netconf-notif-envelope"/>, each message can
			uniquely be identified, loss recognized and related to a transport
			session and publishing process.</t>

      <t></t>
    </section>

    <section title="Solution Detail">
      <t><xref target="arch"/> below shows the distributed data export
      framework.</t>

      <t>A collector usually includes two components,</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>the Subscriber generates the subscription instructions to
      express what and how the Receiver wants to receive the data;
      </t>

          <t>the Receiver is the target for the data publication.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>For one subscription, there can be one or more Receivers. And
      the Subscriber does not necessarily share the same IP address as
      the Receivers.</t>

      <t>In this framework, the Publisher pushes messages to the
			Receiver according to the subscription. The Publisher is either in
			the Parent or Agent role. The Publisher Parent knows all the
      capabilities that his Agents can provide and exposes the Global
      Capability to the collector. The Subscriber maintains the Global
      Subscription at the Publisher Parent and disassembles the Global
      Subscription to multiple Component Subscriptions, depending upon
			which source data is needed. The Component Subscriptions are then
      distributed to the corresponding Publisher Agents on route and
      processors on line cards.</t>

      <t>Publisher Agents collects metrics according to the Component
      Subscription, add its metadata, encapsulates, and pushes 
			messages. Messages may require segmentation depending on the
			amount of YANG data subscribed and maximum transmission unit of
			the interface where the message is published from. The Receiver
			then decapsulates packets and reassembles notifications
			accordingly.</t>

      <t>Publisher Parent and Publisher Agents interact with each other 
    in several ways: <list
          style="symbols">
          <t>Publisher Agents need to register with the Parent at the
      beginning of their process life cycle.</t>

          <t>Contracts are created and maintained throughout the
      subscription lifecycle between the Publisher Parent and each
      Agent and on its Component Capability, and the format for
      notification data structure.</t>

          <t>The Publisher Parent relays the component subscriptions to
      the Publisher Agents.</t>

          <t>The Publisher Agents announce the status of their Component
      Subscriptions to the Publisher Parent. The status of the
      overall subscription is maintained by the Publisher Parent.
      The Publisher Parent is responsible for notifying the
          subscriber in case of problems with the Component
      Subscriptions.</t>
        </list>The technical mechanisms or protocols used for the
    coordination of operational information between Publisher Parent
    and Agent is out of scope of this document.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Subscription Decomposition">
      <t>The Collector can send subscription requests only to the
			Parent. This requires the Publisher Parent to:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>expose the Global Capability that can be served by multiple
          Publisher Agents;</t>

          <t>disassemble the Global Subscription to multiple Component
          Subscriptions, and distribute them to the Publisher Agents of
          the corresponding metric sources from the YANG schema tree so
					that they do not overlap; How the subscription is being
					distributed is implementation specific and not part of this
					document.
      </t>

          <t>notify changes related to the existing subscriptions to the
      different Publisher Agents.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>And the Publisher Agent to:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Inherit the Global Subscription properties from Publisher
      Parent for its Component Subscription;</t>

          <t>share the same life-cycle as the Global Subscription;</t>

          <t>share the same Subscription ID as the Global Subscription.
      </t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section title="Publication Composition">
      <t>The Publisher Agent collects data and encapsulates the packets
    per Component Subscription. The format and structure of the data
    records are defined by the YANG schema, so that the decomposition
    at the Receiver can benefit from the structured and hierarchical
    data records.</t>

      <t>The Receiver can associate the YANG data records with
    <xref target="RFC8639">Subscription ID</xref> to the subscribed
    subscription. Additionally, it can use the Message Publisher ID to
    determine the corresponding publisher process.</t>

      <t>For the dynamic subscription, the output of the
      "establish-subscription" RPC defined in <xref target="RFC8639"/>
    MUST include a list of Message Publisher IDs to indicate how the
    Global Subscription is decomposed into several Component
    Subscriptions.</t>

      <t>The "subscription-started" and "subscription-modified"
    notification defined in <xref target="RFC8639"/> and "push-update"
    and "push-change-update" notification defined in <xref
    target="RFC8641"/> MUST also include a list of Message Publisher
    IDs to notify the current Publishers for the corresponding Global
    Subscription.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Subscription State Change Notifications">
      <t>In addition to sending event records to Receivers, the Parent
    MUST also send <xref target="RFC8639">subscription state change
      notifications</xref> when events related to subscription
    management have occurred. All the subscription state change
    notifications MUST be delivered by the Parent.</t>

      <t>When the subscription decomposition result changes, the
      "subscription-modified" notification MUST be sent to indicate the
    new list of Publisher Agents.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Publisher Configurations">
      <t>This document assumes that all Publisher Agents are
      preconfigured to push data. Publisher Agents that send data are
			selected based on the subscription decomposition result.</t>

      <t>From the Receivers perspective, all Publisher Agents share the
			same source IP address for data export. Depending on distributed
			system architecture this may implemented by using network address
			translation within the distributed system. For connectionless data
			transport such as <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-udp-notif">UDP
			based transport</xref> the same Layer 4 source port for data
			export can be used. For connection based data transport such as
			<xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-https-notif">HTTPS based
			transport</xref>, each Publisher Agent MUST be able to acknowledge
			packet retrieval from Receivers, and therefore requires a
			dedicated Layer 4 source port per software process.</t>

      <t>The specific configuration on transports is described in the
      respective documents.</t>

      <t>This section uses the template described in
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis" section="3.7"/>.</t>

      <t>The 'ietf-distributed-notif' YANG module defines a data model
			that is designed to be accessed via YANG-based management
			protocols, such as NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241"/> and RESTCONF
			<xref target="RFC8040"/>. These YANG-based management protocols
			(1) have to use a secure transport layer (e.g., SSH <xref
			target="RFC6242"/>, TLS <xref target="RFC8446"/>, and QUIC <xref
			target="RFC9000"/>) and (2) have to use mutual authentication.</t>

      <t>The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) <xref
      target="RFC8341"/> provides the means to restrict access for
      particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of
      all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol operations and content.
      </t>

      <t>There are no data nodes defined in this YANG module
      that are writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., "config true", which
      is the default).</t>

      <t>Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be
      considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments. 
      It is thus important to control read access (e.g., via get,
      get-config, or Notification) to these data nodes. Specifically,
      the following subtrees and data nodes have particular
      sensitivities/vulnerabilities:</t>

      <ul>
        <li>/sn:subscriptions/sn:subscription/dn:message-publisher-id</li>
        <li>/sn:subscription-started/dn:message-publisher-id</li>
        <li>/sn:subscription-modified/dn:message-publisher-id</li>
        <li>/sn:establish-subscription/dn:message-publisher-id</li>
      </ul>

      <t>The entries in the list above will show the identity of the
      originating Publisher process. Exposure of this information may
			assist an attacker in mapping the distributed system or in
			injecting spoofed Notifications. Implementations SHOULD ensure
			that access to this data is restricted and that Notifications are
			sent over secure and authenticated channels.</t>

      <t>Security Considerations defined in <xref target="RFC8639"/>
			do also apply for this document.</t>
