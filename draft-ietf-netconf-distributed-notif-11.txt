Internet-Draft          Distributed Notifications          February 2025


1.  Introduction

   The mechanism to support a subscription of a continuous and
   customized stream of updates from a YANG datastore [RFC8342] is
   defined in [RFC8639] and [RFC8641].  Requirements for Subscription to
   YANG Datastores are defined in [RFC7923].

   By streaming YANG-Push notifications from publishers to receivers,
   much better performance and fine-grained sampling can be achieved
   than with a polling-based mechanism.  In a distributed forwarding
   system, the packet forwarding is delegated to multiple processors on
   line cards.  To not to overwhelm the route processor resources, it is
   not uncommon that data records are published directly from processors
   on line cards to target Receivers to further increase efficiency on
   the routing system.

   This document complements the general subscription requirements
   defined in section 4.2.1 of [RFC7923] by the paragraph: A
   Subscription Service MAY support the ability to export from multiple
   software processes on a single routing system and expose the
   information which software process produced which message to maintain
   data integrity.

2.  Terminologies

   The following terms are defined in [RFC8639] and are not redefined
   here:

   Subscriber

   Publisher

   Receiver

   Subscription

   In addition, this document defines the following terms:

   Global Subscription: The Subscription requested by the subscriber.
   It may be decomposed into multiple Component Subscriptions.

   Component Subscription: The Subscription that defines a data source
   which is managed and controlled by a single Publisher.

   Global Capability: The overall subscription capability that the group
   of Publishers can expose to the Subscriber.

Internet-Draft          Distributed Notifications          February 2025


   Component Capability: The subscription capability that each Publisher
   can expose to the Subscriber.

   Publisher Master: The Publisher that interacts with the Subscriber to
   deal with the Global Subscription.  It decomposes the Global
   Subscription to multiple Component Subscriptions and interacts with
   the Publisher Agents.

   Publisher Agent: The Publisher that interacts with the Publisher
   Master to deal with the Component Subscription and pushing the data
   to the Receiver.

   Node: The Publisher that obtains and pushes the data to the Receiver.

   Message Publisher: The Publisher that pushes the message to the
   Receiver.

   Message Publisher ID: A 32-bit identifier of the publishing process
   that is locally unique to the publisher node.  With this identifier
   the publishing process from where the message was published from can
   be uniquely identified.  Receivers SHOULD use the transport session
   and the Publisher ID field to separate different publisher streams
   originating from the same network node.

3.  Motivation

   Lost and corrupt YANG notification messages need to be recognized at
   the receiver to ensure data integrity even when multiple publisher
   processes publishing from the same transport session.

   To preserve data integrity down to the publisher process, the Message
   Publisher ID in the transport message header of the YANG notification
   message is introduced.  In case of UDP transport, this is described
   in Section 3.2 of UDP-based transport [I-D.ietf-netconf-udp-notif].

4.  Solution Overview

   Figure 1 below shows the distributed data export framework.

   A collector usually includes two components,

   *  the Subscriber generates the subscription instructions to express
      what and how the Receiver wants to receive the data;

   *  the Receiver is the target for the data publication.

Internet-Draft          Distributed Notifications          February 2025


   For one subscription, there can be one or more Receivers.  And the
   Subscriber does not necessarily share the same IP address as the
   Receivers.

   In this framework, the Publisher pushes data to the Receiver
   according to the subscription.  The Publisher is either in the Master
   or Agent role.  The Publisher Master knows all the capabilities that
   his Agents can provide and exposes the Global Capability to the
   collector.  The Subscriber maintains the Global Subscription at the
   Publisher Master and disassembles the Global Subscription to multiple
   Component Subscriptions, depending which source data is needed.  The
   Component Subscriptions are then distributed to the corresponding
   Publisher Agents on route and processors on line cards.

   Publisher Agents collects metrics according to the Component
   Subscription, add its metadata, encapsulates, and pushes data to the
   Receiver where packets are reassembled and decapsulated.

              Figure 1: The Distributed Data Export Framework

   Publisher Master and Publisher Agents interact with each other in
   several ways:

Internet-Draft          Distributed Notifications          February 2025


   *  Publisher Agents need to register at the Master at the beginning
      of their process life cycle.

   *  Contracts are created and maintained through the subscription
      lifecycle between the Publisher Master and each Agent on the
      Component Capability, and the format for notification data
      structure.

   *  The Publisher Master relays the component subscriptions to the
      Publisher Agents.

   *  The Publisher Agents announce the status of their Component
      Subscriptions to the Publisher Master.  The status of the overall
      subscription is maintained by the Publisher Master.  The Publisher
      Master is responsible for notifying the subscriber in case of
      problems with the Component Subscriptions.

   The technical mechanisms or protocols used for the coordination of
   operational information between Publisher Master and Agent is out-of-
   scope of this document.

5.  Subscription Decomposition

   The Collector can only subscribe to the Master.  This requires the
   Master to:

   1.  expose the Global Capability that can be served by multiple
       Publisher Agents;

   2.  disassemble the Global Subscription to multiple Component
       Subscriptions, and distribute them to the Publisher Agents of the
       corresponding metric sources so that they not overlap;

   3.  notify on changes when portions of a subscription moving between
       different Publisher Agents over time.

   And the Publisher Agent to:

   *  Inherit the Global Subscription properties from Publisher Master
      for its Component Subscription;

   *  share the same life-cycle as the Global Subscription;

   *  share the same Subscription ID as the Global Subscription.

Internet-Draft          Distributed Notifications          February 2025


6.  Publication Composition

   The Publisher Agent collects data and encapsulates the packets per
   Component Subscription.  The format and structure of the data records
   are defined by the YANG schema, so that the decomposition at the
   Receiver can benefit from the structured and hierarchical data
   records.

   The Receiver is able to associate the YANG data records with
   Subscription ID [RFC8639] to the subscribed subscription and with
   Message Publisher ID to one of the publisher processes to enable
   message integrity.

   For the dynamic subscription, the output of the "establish-
   subscription" RPC defined in [RFC8639] MUST include a list of Message
   Publisher IDs to indicate how the Global Subscription is decomposed
   into several Component Subscriptions.

   The "subscription-started" and "subscription-modified" notification
   defined in [RFC8639] and "push-update" and "push-change-update"
   notification defined in [RFC8641] MUST also include a list of Message
   Publisher IDs to notify the current Publishers for the corresponding
   Global Subscription.

7.  Subscription State Change Notifications

   In addition to sending event records to Receivers, the Master MUST
   also send subscription state change notifications [RFC8639] when
   events related to subscription management have occurred.  All the
   subscription state change notifications MUST be delivered by the
   Master.

   When the subscription decomposition result changed, the
   "subscription-modified" notification MUST be sent to indicate the new
   list of Publisher Agents.

8.  Publisher Configurations

   This document assumes that all Publisher Agents are preconfigured to
   push data.  The actual working Publisher Agents are selected based on
   the subscription decomposition result.

Internet-Draft          Distributed Notifications          February 2025


   All Publisher Agents share the same source IP address for data
   export.  For connectionless data transport such as UDP based
   transport [I-D.ietf-netconf-udp-notif] the same Layer 4 source port
   for data export can be used.  For connection based data transport
   such as HTTPS based transport [I-D.ietf-netconf-https-notif], each
   Publisher Agent MUST be able to acknowledge packet retrieval from
   Receivers, and therefore requires a dedicated Layer 4 source port per
   software process.

   The specific configuration on transports is described in the
   responsible documents.

12.1.  Open Source Publisher

   INSA Lyon implemented this document for a YANG Push publisher on
   UDP-based Transport for Configured Subscriptions
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-udp-notif] in an example implementation.

   The open source code can be obtained here: [INSA-Lyon-Publisher].

12.2.  Open Source Receiver Library

   INSA Lyon implemented this document for a YANG Push receiver on
   UDP-based Transport for Configured Subscriptions
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-udp-notif] as a library.

   The open source code can be obtained here: [INSA-Lyon-Receiver].

12.3.  Pmacct Data Collection

   The open source YANG push receiver library has been integrated into
   the Pmacct open source Network Telemetry data collection.

12.4.  Huawei VRP

   Huawei implemented this document for a YANG Push publisher on
   UDP-based Transport for Configured Subscriptions
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-udp-notif] in their VRP platform.

12.5.  6WIND VSR

   6WIND implemented this document for a YANG Push publisher on
   UDP-based Transport for Configured Subscriptions
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-udp-notif] in their VSR platform.

13.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC5246].

   The NETCONF Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC6536] provides the means
   to restrict access particulary for NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   The new data nodes introduced in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get-config or
   notification) to this data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   *  /subscriptions/subscription/message-publisher-ids

   The entries in the two lists above will show where subscribed
   resources might be located on the publishers.  Access control MUST be
   set so that only someone with proper access permissions has the
   ability to access this resource.

   Other Security Considerations is the same as those discussed in
   [RFC8639].

                Figure 2: Call Flow for Dynamic Subscription

   A "establish-subscription" RPC request as per [RFC8641] is sent to
   the Master with a successful response.  An example of using NETCONF:

                 Figure 3: "establish-subscription" Request

   As the network node is able to fully satisfy the request, the request
   is given a subscription ID of 22.  The response as in Figure 4
   indicates that the subscription is decomposed into two component
   subscriptions which will be published by two message Message
   Publisher ID: #1 and #2.

   <rpc-reply message-id="101"

   The subscriber may invoke the "modify-subscription" RPC for a
   subscription it previously established.  The RPC has no difference to
   the single publisher case as in [RFC8641].  Figure 5 provides an
   example where a subscriber attempts to modify the period and
   datastore XPath filter of a subscription using NETCONF.

        <rpc message-id="102"
          xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">

           <yp:period>250</yp:period>

        </modify-subscription>
     </rpc>

                  Figure 5: "modify-subscription" Request

   If the modification is successfully accepted, the "subscription-
   modified" subscription state notification is sent to the subscriber
   by the Master.  The notification, Figure 6 for example, indicates the
   modified subscription is decomposed into one component subscription
   which will be published by message Message Publisher ID #1.

              Figure 7: Call Flow for Configured Subscription

   Before starting to push data, the "subscription-started" subscription
   state notification is sent to the Receiver.  The following example
   assumes the NETCONF transport has already established.  The
   notification indicates that the configured subscription is decomposed
   into two component subscriptions which will be published by two
   message Message Publisher IDs: #1 and #2.
